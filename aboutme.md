# About Me

I’m Shivshankar Umashankar, an AI and healthcare data science leader with over 15 years of experience. My work has spanned across healthcare IT, life sciences, and public health analytics, focusing on AI-driven solutions, knowledge graphs, and personalized medicine. With a strong background in healthcare systems, I’ve been involved in transforming patient care and healthcare delivery through cutting-edge data science.

## My Expertise

I specialize in:
- **AI and Machine Learning in Healthcare**: Developing AI-based models to improve predictive care and optimize healthcare outcomes.
- **Knowledge Graphs**: Designing healthcare knowledge graphs that integrate clinical, genomic, IoT, and social determinants of health (SDoH) data.
- **Ethics in AI**: Focusing on governance frameworks to ensure AI is used ethically in healthcare, with special attention to fairness and accountability.
- **Personalized Medicine**: Applying AI to analyze patient health data, tailoring treatments, and improving patient outcomes through individualized care.

## Projects I’ve Worked On

### 1. **Lead Data Scientist at Holmusk**
At Holmusk, I spearheaded projects that leveraged multi-modal healthcare data (EHR, SDoH, claims) to predict patient outcomes and optimize treatment protocols. My key contributions included:
- Developing **population health models** to identify at-risk populations and improve healthcare delivery.
- Implementing **data governance frameworks** in Databricks, ensuring the quality and scalability of data pipelines for healthcare insights.

### 2. **Product Manager/ Data Scientist at PatSnap**
As a Product Manager at PatSnap, I worked on building AI-powered life sciences platforms, driving strategic R&D decision-making. Key projects include:
- **AI-Driven Knowledge Graphs**: Developed a connected intelligence platform that integrates various life sciences data sources, helping healthcare organizations and life sciences companies make informed R&D decisions.
- Managing cross-functional teams to deploy **AI/ML-based SaaS products** for the healthcare and life sciences sectors, resulting in improved healthcare R&D efficiency.

### 3. **Post-Doctoral Research Fellow at SCELSE (NUS)**
During my time at the Singapore Centre for Environmental Life Sciences Engineering (SCELSE), I led the development of machine learning models and natural language processing (NLP) pipelines for public health and environmental life sciences. Key achievements:
- Designed **NLP algorithms** for mining and analyzing large healthcare datasets, improving the identification of patient traits and optimizing public health strategies.
- Led research initiatives focused on **food and healthcare security**, enhancing the integration of healthcare analytics in national programs.

## My Vision

I am deeply committed to using AI and data to transform healthcare. I believe in creating solutions that not only enhance patient care but also uphold ethical standards in AI development. By leveraging knowledge graphs and personalized medicine, my goal is to help healthcare systems become more efficient and effective.
